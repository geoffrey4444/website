          <p>ImageInversion is a <a href="https://www.apple.com/macos">macOS</a> app that inverts the colors in an image.</p>         
          
          <p>I wrote this little app to help me convert light mode graphics to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light-on-dark_color_scheme">dark mode</a> on the fly, since
          I like to use dark backgrounds in my presentations. It also is an easy way to make
          negative images of photos.</p>

            Just drag an image into ImageInversion, then drag the result into
            another app. Or drag the result onto your desktop to save it as a
            new PNG image file.                                    
            </p>
            <h2>Features</h2>
            <p>
            <ul>
              <li>Invert images in a variety of formats, such as PNG, JPEG, and PDF.</li>
              <li>Generates inverted bitmap images, such as PNG files.</li>
              <li>Use drag and drop or copy and paste. </li>
              <li>Optionally, only swap black and white,
                preserving other colors. NOTE: This option works best with
                high-resolution charts and simple graphics. It does not work well
                for photos.</li>
            </ul>

    <h2>A note to purchasers of the macOS App Store version of ImageInversion</h2>
    <p>To users who purchased the macOS version of ImageInversion, thank you very much for your support.
    I'm sorry that I'm no longer able to provide the app through the Apple App Store.</p>
    <p>As a solo, hobbyist developer,
    I haven't been able to figure out how to ensure my app complies with new age verification laws, such as 
    <a href="https://capitol.texas.gov/tlodocs/89R/billtext/pdf/SB02420F.pdf">the Texas App Store Accountability Act</a>. Apple has 
    released <a href="https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=btkirlj8">some new APIs</a> meant to assist with this. Even so, I remain
    unsure what I would have to do to comply with such laws, and I'm concerned about the legal risk these laws introduce. As a result,
    I've reluctantly chosen to pull the macOS app from Apple's App Store.</p>

    <p>To make sure that everyone who purchased the app continues to have access to it, I have decided 
      to release ImageInversion for free directly from my website.</p>

          or questions about ImageInversion's <a
          href="PrivacyPolicy.txt">privacy policy</a> (the Apple App Store requires
          you to have a privacy policy, even though ImageVersion doesn't collect
          any personal information at all), please contact me at <a
